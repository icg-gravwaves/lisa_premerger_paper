# Injections

We set the injections according to the desired behaviour of the signals.

We see in the [notebook](make_injections.ipynb), that the masses, spins, time offset from merger to the end of the data, and distance are set manually.

All other parameters are set randomly according to the distributions defined in Table I of the paper.

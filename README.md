# Premerger observation and characterization of super-massive black hole binaries

This is the data release for the paper "Premerger observation and characterization of super-massive black hole binaries", which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). We release the data behind each of the figures and the code and configuration files that were used to produce each of them. We also demonstrate the steps needed to reproduce the search and parameter estimation using our code.

As always python, software dependencies will change in the coming years, and this code may be incompatible with future releases of any dependency. This paper was generated using a fork of PyCBC at https://github.com/icg-gravwaves/pycbc/tree/lisa-pre-merger. This was forked from PyCBC at cd0e16a.

FIXME: sort a docker image somewhere (zenodo?) once code is finalised

## Reproducing our figures

## Reproducing our analysis

### Generating the template bank

### Running searches on supplied files with injections

### Running searches on generated noise without injections

### Running parameter estimation on injections

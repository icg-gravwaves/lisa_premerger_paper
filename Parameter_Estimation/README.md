# Parameter Estimation

This directory contains an example parameter estimation configuration.


## Running analyses

To run the analyses, we use [PyCBC Inference](https://pycbc.org/pycbc/latest/html/inference.html). This should be run for each injection and time IDs.

For example, we set environment variables:
- INJ_ID to the injection we want
- TIME_ID to the time we are considering (see the following table)
- PSD to `cut`, `optimistic` or `pessimistic` depending on the PSD we want
- CONFIG_PATH to point to the [configs subdirectory](Config_Files) located in this repo.
- OUTDIR to be the output directory for this specific analysis, we suggest `outdir_injection${INJ_ID}_time${TIME_ID}_${PSD}_psd`

| Time ID | Time before merger (days) |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 14 |
| 2 | 7 |
| 3 | 4 |
| 4 | 1 |
| 5 | 0.5 |

> üìù Some options may need tweaking based on your computing setup, particularly `--nprocesses`

## Conventions

We use the convention that the mass ratio is defined to be less than one, such that `q=m2/m1`. This is different to the default in PyCBC Inference and, as such, the parameter is labelled `mass_ratio` rather than `q` in the config files.

## Producing merged result files

```bash
python merge_results.py --result-mapping results.yml --output-dir analyses/
```

## Generating sky maps

> üìù The sky maps are generated using a different environment that is specified in `skymap_env.yml`. Once installed, this can be activated using `conda activate pycbc-pre-merger-skymap`. See the [conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) for how to create a conda environment from a YAML file.

Generating the sky maps requires the merged result files, for details see [this section](#producing-merged-result-files).
Once these have been generated, the sky map files for a given injection and PSD are produced by running the following command:

```bash
python produce_skymaps.py --result-dir results/ --output-dir results/skymaps/ --injection-id <id> --psd <psd> --jobs 8 --trials 4
```

where `<id>` and `<psd>` should be set accordingly.

**Note:** this will sky runs with existing sky maps.

Alternatively, the `iterate_skymaps.sh` script can be used to iterate over all the results for a single PSD:

```bash
bash iterate_skymaps.sh <psd>
```

where `<psd>` can be one of `{optimistic, pessimistic, cut}`.
